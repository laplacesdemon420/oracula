The outcomes of Augur’s prediction markets are chosen by users that hold Augur’s native 
Reputation token, who stake their tokens on the actual observed outcome and, in return, 
receive settlement fees from the markets

- honest accurate reporting should always be the most profitable for REP holders

- can post progressively larger bonds to dispute proposed market outcomes
  - at a certain treshold, REP splits into multiple versions. Holder then choose which version they
    want.
  - 

Augur markets follow a four-stage progression: creation, trading, reporting, and settlement.

- users report by staking their REP on an outcome.

Each staked REP token entitles its holder to an equal portion of Augur’s market fees.

market creator 
  - chooses a designated reporter, so not anyone can propose. But anyone can dispute.
  - resolution source can be common knowledge, or something more specific like a website.
  - posts two bonds: validity bond and creation bond
    - validity bond is in DAI and is returned if the market resolves
    - creation bond is in REP and is return iff the designated reporter reports in 24h and iff correct
